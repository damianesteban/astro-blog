Code, to me, is a form of poetry; a beautiful melange of logic, creativity, and innovation. It's about solving problems and sculpting solutions that can make a difference. It's the lifeblood of the digital age, and its potential is boundless. This love of code is what initially drove me to technology and keeps fueling my passion even today.

My love of code and team building run parallel. Assembling a skilled engineering team is an art. It's about creating a shared vision, a community, and a commitment. It's about fostering an environment of growth, where each member brings their unique talents to the table, complementing and learning from each other. I've assembled multiple teams and invested my time, energy, and faith into their creation.

The teams I've put together were not just a group of individuals who coded together and clocked out at 5:00 PM. My team members were comrades, each a piece in a puzzle, working in lockstep to accomplish great things. We built an engineering *family*, bonded by our love of problem-solving and technology. Our achievements were a testament to the power of teamwork, where unity, combined with passion and expertise, led us to conquer difficult challenges.

The intrinsic worth of teams such as these is not recognized by everyone. Assigning a tangible monetary worth to them is challenging, yet many attempt to do so. It is dangerous to look at engineering teams in terms of pure dollars and cents - the shared knowledge, camaraderie, wealth of experience working together, and cohesion cannot be easily replicated or replaced.

From the bottom of my heart I thank all my team members, both past and present, for being a part of something special. *Go team*.
